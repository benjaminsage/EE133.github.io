## Abstract

Passive components in electronics are devices which only receive energy to be manipulated, but need no power to operate. Three of these components - resistors, capacitors, and inductors - form the basis of circuit design and analysis. In this lab, we analyze these three components using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to see where they deviate from their theoretical behavior in real life. This analysis gives rise to an important discovery known as self-resonant frequency.

## Introduction

There are three principle passive components in electronic circuit analysis:
- Resistor
- Capacitor
- Inductor

Their impedance formulas follow, with R standing for Resistor, C for Capacitor, and L for Inductor:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z_C = \frac{-j}{\omega C}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z_L = j \omega L">

These are, however, theoretical only. Every resistor, capacitor, and inductor, in real life, actually contains all three of these components. A real resistor actually has a theoretical resistor, capacitor, and inductor, as do real capacitors and inductors.

The additional theoretical components are known as **pararasitics**.
