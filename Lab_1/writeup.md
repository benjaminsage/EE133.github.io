## Abstract

Passive components in electronics are devices which only receive energy to be manipulated, but need no power to operate. Three of these components - resistors, capacitors, and inductors - form the basis of circuit design and analysis. In this lab, we analyze these three components using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to see where they deviate from their theoretical behavior in real life. This analysis gives rise to an important discovery known as self-resonant frequency.
